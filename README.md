<h2>Description</h2>
In this malware analysis project, the focus was on dissecting the Zeus Banking Trojan within a controlled sandbox environment facilitated by Flare VM and a Remnux server acting as a DNS server to isolate the malware from the network. Utilizing tools such as Procmon for system activity monitoring, VirusTotal for extensive malware scanning, and the CMder emulator for seamless command-line execution, the project aimed to uncover the intricacies of the Zeus Banking Trojan's behavior. Through meticulous analysis, including real-time monitoring of system activities and comprehensive scanning for indicators of compromise, valuable insights were obtained into the malware's capabilities, prevalence, and potential impacts. Documenting all reports and findings onto a document was crucial in consolidating the observations and recommendations gleaned from the analysis. This project underscores the importance of leveraging sophisticated analysis techniques and tools to better understand and mitigate the threats posed by banking trojans like Zeus in the cybersecurity landscape.
